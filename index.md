### **Data Analysis in Humanitarian Settings**

I am a Disaster Management Expert and Data Analyst with a strong track record of advisory services, quality assurance and effective programme management in large-scale Emergency, Recovery and National Development Programmes. I have worked in emergencies in Sri Lanka, China, Japan, Thailand, Philippines, Nepal, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Venezuela. 

I have more than 10 years of expertise in (according to the approximate amount of time spent): 
Analytics & Research [19.2%]; Data Processing [18.5%]; Policy & Planning [18.4%]; Leadership & Capacity Building [17.9%]; Quality Assurance [16.8%]; and Coordination & Negotiation [9.2%].

I am a committed advocate of data transparency and inter-agency sharing in humanitarian and development settings.

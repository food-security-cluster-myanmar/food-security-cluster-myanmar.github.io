# **Myanmar Food Security Cluster**

### **Reports and Analysis**

The people of Myanmar are facing an unprecedented political, socioeconomic, human rights and humanitarian crisis with needs escalating dramatically since the military takeover and a severe third wave fo COVID-19 in 2021. The expansion of armed conflict into and formation of new armed elements in new areas is driving increased displacement and has exacerbated and generated new protection and assistance needs. The military takeover and the large-scale civil disobedience movement that has followed has heavily impacted the emerging economy and the already fragile public service sector, further restricting people's access to essential services and children's access to education. These inter-related risks have also deepened pre-existing needs among the already vulnerable groups, including stateless Rohingya people and people living in protracted displacement. 

The economic and political turmoil of 2021 is projected to have driven almost half the population into poverty. Increasing numbers of vulnerable people are exhausting their coping capacity and are now slipping into humanitarian need. Price hikes, COVID-19 movement restrictions and ongoing insecurity have forced the most vulnerable to resort to crisis or emergency coping strategies to buy food and other basic supplies. Prices for key household commodities in some states and regions have risen significantly, making some food items increasingly unaffordable. Farming incomes have been affected by lower wholesale prices for some crops, higher input prices and lower farm gate prices and limited access to credit. Open conflict, inter-communal tensions and recurrent climate-related shocks continue to undermine the stability and availability of food supplies as well as physical and economic access to food.

# **Myanmar Food Security Cluster**

### **Reports and Analysis**

An estimated 779,000 women, girls, boys, and men living in conflict-affected areas in Myanmar are vulnerable to severe food insecurity. The main humanitarian needs include economic and physical access, as well as availability of nutritious and diversified food at household and community levels.

Long-standing conflict in Kachin and Shan, inter-communal tensions in Rakhine, and recurrent climate-related shocks continue to undermine the stability and availability of food supplies as well as physical and economic access to food.  

This site hosts analysis and reports such as:
